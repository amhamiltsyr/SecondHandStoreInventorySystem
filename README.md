# Second-Hand Store Inventory System
An Inventory web page for second-hand retail stores

Setting up the Django Environment (get more help @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc):
$ python3 install django

Running the website:
$ python3 manage.py runserver
Clicking the link in the terminal output, you should be brought to a successful landing page 
(NOTE: Right now, it will just be the Django install successful site. Later, this will be our website)
